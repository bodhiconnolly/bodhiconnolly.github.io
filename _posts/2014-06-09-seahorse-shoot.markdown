The Gold Coast very much has a canal estate culture, and as such watersports enjoy pretty high popularity. There's a great team over at <a href="seahorseski.com">Seahorse Ski</a> who are developing a tool that teaches beginners to barefoot ski. As someone who has now tried to ski barefoot with and without this seat, I can safely say it makes it a hundred times easier. 

Anyway, they're now in the marketing stage of their product and they hired me to make a promotional video for web audiences. It had to be shot pretty quickly, we went out on the boat with three groups of people and I filmed them while they tried it out. The angles available were pretty limited without a second vessel, as we were on a small boat. I took out a GoPro 3 that I had lying around and attached it to a broom handle to try and change things up but it didn't help much. If things progress further we can get a second boat (or maybe even a quad) to broaden out the shots. Also, due to the fact that I was shooting handheld on a boat I used my old 18-55mm kit lens. Not ideal, but I really didn't want to ruin any nice gear. 

The music is from the YouTube Audio Library which is a pretty neat resource, but they need to add some more content because I'm starting to hear the same songs a lot. The guys also had some previous phone footage of younger kids using the seahorse which they wanted to show. I tried to colour them before I put them in, and the consensus from friends was that they matched well enough. The setup shots were another last-minute addition to add variety and show some more info about the product. Some lights would've been nice as the boat ramp was in mottled sunlight but leveraging the low sun with natural lighting is good enough.
