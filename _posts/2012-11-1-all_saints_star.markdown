Recently I was hired to shoot All Saints Anglican School's Guinness World Record attempt at the largest human star, part of their annual charity event Giveathon. This is my second time documenting a world record attempt (the first being a 100 x 100m freestyle relay, which still holds the record at the time of this post at 1:37:53 hours) and they are always a lot of fun, despite the stringent requirements set out by Guiness.

My role was two-fold: to record a timelapse of the entire event for documentation purposes, and to get a bird's eye view photo of the entire star for publicity purposes. The second, of course, involves a helicopter. Marvellous.

The timelapse was a fairly standard affair, shooting on my Canon 600D with a 15-85mm to get the whole star in and using Magic Lantern as my intervalometer. The chopper required more careful planning - as we only had a short flight time, I needed to be certain that I could get all of the shots I needed as fast as possible. In the end I flew with two 7Ds (chosen for their burst mode), one with a 70-200mm for close-ups and one with a 17-55mm for capturing the whole school. 

With this setup getting the required shots was really quite simple and everyone was happy with the results. It helps if you have someone knowledgeable about aviation who can give the pilot detailed instructions. I am not, but the two videographers in the back were and they gave the instructions. They also captured some footage which is embedded below.
