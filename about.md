I'm an mechatronic engineering student at the University of Queensland. I love taking on extra projects in this area (particularly when flashing lights are involved!) and will be documenting such projects here.

I also have a passion for filmmkaing and work both as a freelance videographer and on personal films. These too will be documented on this site.
