## I love making things.

I'm first and foremost a mechatronic engineering student at the University of Queensland, Australia. Focussing on the harmony of software and electrical components, I love nothing more than when code is brought alive in the physical realm. Aside from university applications I enjoy taking on extra projects in this area (particularly when flashing lights are involved!) and will be documenting such projects here.

I also have a passion for filmmaking and work both as a freelance videographer and on personal films. These too will be documented on this site.
